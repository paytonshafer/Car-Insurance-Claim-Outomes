The goal of this notebook is to identify the best feature in the dataset to predict whether a customer will make a claim on their insurance during the policy period. I will create a simple Logistic Regression model for each  feature to indentify the single feature that results in the best perfroming model. The dataset constists of a plethora of features that describe a client and an outcome column that that notes if they have filed a claim. \n","\n","The data is saved as a csv file called `car_insurance.csv`. There is a table detailing the column names and descriptions below."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8928ffdf-25d6-4ad9-909f-0dd8d10b9a42","metadata":{},"source":["\n","\n","## The
